# GaloisClassFieldTheoryQ
Short programs to do number-theoretic computations concerning quantum mechanics.
They shall run by computer algebra system SINGULAR GAP PARI/GP

  PURPOSE:
    MODEL HAMILTONIAN IN QUANTUM MECHANICS. 
    THE IDEAL FROM THE SECULAR EQUATION.
    PRIMARY IDEAL DECOMPOSITION.
  CAVEAT
    WRITTEN FOR VARIOUS MODEL MOLECULE. YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE HOW THEY ARE B Y CHECKING THE MODEL HAMILTONIAN.

 PURPOSE:  Computation D4 group. THE REPRESENTATION MINIMAL GENERATORS. THE ISOMORPHISM BETWEEN DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIONS. 

PARI/GP
  FILE:    galoismol.txt frobemius.txt factorzationinsubfields.txt
  PURPOSE: To do computations concerning Field Extension to solve problems in quantum mechanics.
  
The general purpose of these short programs shall be explained minutely by a fourthcoming paper.
